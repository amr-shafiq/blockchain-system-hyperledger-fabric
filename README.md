# Blockchain System Prototype (Hyperledger Fabric)

This project was built as part of my university coursework for a Blockchain Development module. It is a backend prototype of a private blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric, focusing on smart contracts and basic network setup.

## Project Summary

- **Platform Used**: IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code (now discontinued)
- **Backend Only**: No frontend or UI was developed.
- **Main Focus**:
  - Creating a Fabric network (Peers, Orderer, CA)
  - Writing chaincode (smart contracts)
  - Testing transactions using VS Code extension and CLI

## Limitations

Due to the dependency on IBM Blockchain Platform and the evolving state of Hyperledger Fabric, this project may not run on modern setups without considerable updates. It remains as a demonstration of early backend blockchain development skills.

## Lessons Learned

- Gained exposure to Hyperledger Fabric architecture.
- Hands-on experience with writing and deploying basic chaincode.
- Understood core concepts like channels, endorsement policies, MSPs, and certificate authorities.

## Remarks

This project has been considered into integrating with only backend blockchain development, frontend has not been built yet.
